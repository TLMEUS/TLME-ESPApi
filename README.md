# TLME-Framework

This is an MVC Framework I created during a course in college. I like it because it does not have the bloat that other frameworks do, just the basics.

While I do write my software as a source of income, I feel I would not be here if it were not for all the software authors I have learned from over the years. So I am putting my completed projects here for others to learn from. Full ownership of the software contained in this and my other respositories is retained by myself. If you find something in my software you feel you could use, please email me at owner@troylmarkerenterpreises.com and we can discuss arrangements for your use of it.
